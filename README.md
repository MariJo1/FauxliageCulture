### Cultural History of Pesticide: "The Desolate Year", published by the Monsanto Company in 1962
"A brochure published by the agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto in 1962 in response to Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, which was a foundational work in early environmentalism criticizing the uncontrolled usage of pesticides and DDT in particular. The brochure tells the story of what they believe America would look like were the government to ban the usage of pesticides." (From The Internet Archive) Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" remains an influential work in the history of environmental literature and is often required reading for those interested in environmental science and conservation. It's a testament to the power of scientific literature to bring attention to critical environmental issues and drive change.

### Insect Repellent Ads, Mortein, 1949
How did 20th century advertisements for insect repellents consitute the pest? Mortein is a well-known brand of household insecticides and pest control products. The brand is owned by Reckitt Benckiser, a British multinational consumer goods company. Mortein products are designed to help people combat various pests, primarily insects, including mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches, ants, and other common household pests.
History: Mortein was originally an Australian brand, founded by J. Hagemann in 1878. The brand's name is derived from a combination of the French word "mort" (meaning "dead") and "Einstein," referencing the scientist Albert Einstein. In 1936, Mortein introduced its iconic slogan, "When you're dead, you're dead."

Environmental Concerns: Like many companies in the pest control industry, Mortein has faced scrutiny and challenges related to the environmental impact of its products. There have been concerns about the use of certain chemicals in insecticides and their effects on the environment. In response to these concerns, Mortein, like other companies, has been working on developing more environmentally friendly and sustainable pest control solutions.
Image: Mortein is known for its distinctive packaging and branding, often featuring the image of a dead insect, reinforcing its promise of effective pest control.

### Multispecies Consumption: Insects, Fungi, Bacteria
Humans, animals, and birds are not the only consumers of the peanut plant. In texts on peanut cultivation for human consumption like *The Peanut, the unpredictable legume; a symposium* (1951) published by the National Fertilizer Association in the U.S, we find the assertive presence of insects, fungi, and bacteria that feed on the peanut foliage, subterranean parts, and delicious pods.[^25] Insects like the Indian Meal Moth, <span eid="Q2893450">Almond Moth</span>, Saw-toothed Grain Beetle, and <span eid="Q102347715">Flour Beetles</span> are observed to consume peanuts after their harvest and when they are in storage. The consumption of the peanut plant by the insect is represented within the text as infestation by 'pests' which cause crop damage directly translating to economic ‘damage’. The insects in the network visualization are but a few of the many wondrous creatures that share humanity’s appetite for the peanut plant. While this network is by no means an exhaustive list of all the insects that feed on the peanut plant, it opens up thinking about the plant as providing nutrients to multiple life forms beyond the human.

       center="Arachis hypogaea">

The text also notes other life forms that consume the peanut which include bacterial and fungal entities which leave their unique markers of consumption: “<span eid="Q4840003">bacterial wilt</span> in the East Indies, <span eid="Q58935125">rosette</span> in Africa, and <span eid="Q6508875">leaf spot</span> in the southern United States”.[^26] The <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="195,105,766,725">roots</span> of the peanut plant are the center for multi-species reciprocity with <span eid="Q9164450">nitrogen-fixing bacteria</span> which take from and give back to the soil. Even after harvesting the plant, the peanut shells are sometimes returned to the soil to be used as fertilizer [^27]; to be 'consumed' by the soil.
