### Key Texts in the Cultural History of Pesticide: "The Desolate Year", published by the Monsanto Company in 1962
"A brochure published by the agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto in 1962 in response to Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, which was a foundational work in early environmentalism criticizing the uncontrolled usage of pesticides and DDT in particular. The brochure tells the story of what they believe America would look like were the government to ban the usage of pesticides." (From The Internet Archive)

### The Origins of Peanut Cultivation and Consumption
The cultivated peanut is one of many species of the *Arachis* genus which is thought to have originated east of the Andes mountain range in the area corresponding to modern-day northwestern Argentina, southeastern Bolivia, northern Paraguay, and western Brazil.[^2] The exact period of peanut cultivation by <span eid="Q3122657">Andean civilizations</span> is unclear but domesticated peanut remains have been dated back more than 7000 years.[^3] The high protein content of the peanut made it an important calorie-dense feature of the Andean diet. In his 1609 history of the <span eid="Q3404008">Inca civilization</span>, mestizo chronicler Inca Garcilaso de la Vega records peanuts, or <span data-click-image-zoomto="551,753,677,585">*ynchic*</span>, being eaten toasted and used to make a kind of nougat in combination with honey, but notes that they cause a headache when eaten raw.[^4] He further highlights that peanut oil can be extracted and used to cure many illnesses.

As "El Inca" suggests, peanuts were more than just an important food source, they were also a prestigious item with symbolic and religious importance and a connection to societal elites. The <span eid="Q208188">Moche culture</span> in northern Peru immortalised peanuts in metalwork and on ritual and funerary ceramics, and associated them with death, agricultural production and fertility, in part because of the peanut’s subterranean growth process.[^5] They were also used in competitive feasts and as a ceremonial offering. The high status of peanuts is perhaps best immortalised in an elaborate gold and silver necklace that was discovered in the Royal Tombs of Sipan in 1980 where the warrior-priest leaders of the Moche were buried.

Peanuts were also held in high regard in <span eid="Q13703">Mesoamerica</span>, having gradually spread further north via trade networks. In the <span eid="Q12542">Aztec</span> capital of <span eid="Q13695">Tenochtitlan</span>, the location of present day Mexico City, the peanut was known as *tlalcacahuatl* from the words *tlalli* (earth) and *cacahuatl* (cocoa), giving rise to one of the Spanish words for peanut, *cacahuate/cacahuete*, and suggesting that the Aztec may have been the first humans to combine these two now-ubiquitous flavors.[^6] Although they were less common here than in South America, peanuts were similarly noted for their medicinal properties. They are included in Book Eleven, *Earthly Things*, of the twelve-volume *General History of the Things of New Spain*, also known as the <span eid="Q1106019">Florentine Codex</span>, which was compiled by the Spanish Friar <span eid="Q379972">Bernardino de Sahagún</span> in collaboration with his indigenous students during the sixteenth century and gave a comprehensive account of Aztec culture, society and natural history in order to facilitate Spanish evagelization work. Here, *tlalacacahuatl* is described as a “root” to be given ground up in water to those with a fever, allowing them to expel the ailment in their urine. [^7]


    
### Out of the Americas
Peanuts were first encountered by the Spanish on the Caribbean island of <span eid="Q25277">Hispaniola</span> in the late fifteenth century, where they were known by the name *maní* in the indigeous <span eid="Q5232952">Taíno</span> language. *Maní* is still the predominant name for peanuts in Latin America today, having been adopted into Spanish. Diverging from the appreciation of peanuts by many Pre-Columbian societies, Spanish chronicler <span eid="Q919967">Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo</span> linked their consumption on the island to people of low social standing who were not true Christians.[^8] The Spanish located them here as well as in the continental Americas, which led to confusion about the plant’s origins until peanut remains were located in a Pre-colombian tomb in Peru during the nineteenth century.[^9]

While the arrival of the peanut in Europe was relatively slow, <span eid="Q683846">Spanish Galleons</span> transported peanuts westward from the Americas to <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="15.20,131.31">China, the Philippines, and the Pacific Islands</span> throughout the sixteenth century. Simultaneously, peanuts were being transported across the world by the Portuguese, who had also encountered the legume in Brazil around 1500. The peanut was transported from Brazil to the <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="-16.13,-12.30">Portuguese enclaves on the West Coast of Africa</span>, where it spread across the continent. The peanut was often used as sustenance for enslaved peoples as it could be stored for long periods of time and its hard outer shell helped to protect it from spoilage. From Africa, it was  transported to <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="2.64,60.29">Portuguese India</span>, where it was initially termed the "Mozambique bean," and also to China.

The first mention of peanuts in a Chinese text dates to 1503, a mere decade after Columbus' "discovery" of the Americas. The manuscript describes boiled or cooked peanuts as "delicious" and gives the origin of its Chinese name 落花生 *luo hua sheng* (commonly now just 花生 *hua sheng*), literally "born from a fallen flower," which is how peanuts were thought to grow.[^10] Over the next centuries, peanuts rose in popularity across China as they gradually spread inland from the trading ports of southern coastal cities. Though now ubiquitous in Chinese cuisine, peanuts were a luxury food served at banquets and out of reach for many until the 19th century. The peanut came to be imbued with new cultural meanings as well, as shown in the <span eid="Q8733">Qing Dynasty</span> agate carving to the right depicting a pair of peanuts alongside red dates. The carving is a play on words: the characters for red date (枣, *zao*) and peanut (生, *sheng*), are homophones for the first two characters of the auspicious greeting 早生贵子 *zao sheng gui zi*, an encouragement for newly wed couples to soon have children.[^11]

### Mass Consumption: Peanuts as American Staple       
Although peanuts originated in South America, their journey north was circuitous—in fact, peanuts were introduced to the United States through Africa, crossing the Atlantic in the hulls of slave ships. This history is embedded in the language of peanuts—the common moniker “goober” entered American English from *nguba* in Kimbundu, a language spoken in Angola; “pinder,” another term for peanuts in the American South, derives from *mpinda* in the Kongo language.[^12] In contrast to the peanut's high status in the pre-Colombian Americas and Qing China, in early 19th-century America peanuts were often planted by slave communities and otherwise used as feed for livestock. It was around the <span eid="Q8676">Civil War</span> that peanuts became more widely popular among southern whites. Southerners turned to peanuts in the face of wartime food shortages, and the crop’s military utility was exploited as peanut oil replaced embargoed Northern whale oil as machinery lubricant.[^13] The popularity of peanuts at the time is commemorated in the southern folk song once sung by Confederate soldiers, “Goober Peas.” The lyrics and music are humorously attributed to "A. Pinder" and "P. Nut," both puns on the peanut's name. After the war, spurred on by advances in agricultural technology, the peanut spread throughout the country.

Instrumental to the rise of the peanut was <span eid="Q296898">George Washington Carver</span>, the pioneering Black agricultural scientist, who devoted much of his career to popularizing the crop. Carver, who was born into slavery in Missouri and taught at the Tuskegee Institute during his scientific career, sought to promote crops that could be planted as an alternative to cotton in the American South. Over a century of cotton monoculure had caused widespread nutrient depletion and erosion in the southern soils, and so Carver proposed peanuts as a solution: As nitrogen-fixing legumes, peanuts could return nutrients to the soil as part of a crop rotation that would boost the yield of future cotton plantings. A [1916 Tuskegee Institute report](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/209426#page/17/mode/1up) illustrates Carver’s incredible creativity in devising 105 recipes for peanut-based foods; he also invented a number of other uses for peanuts, including products made from peanut oil.[^14] An influential Black public figure during the age of segregation, Carver promoted peanut production on a local and a national scale—he even testified on behalf of peanut farmers before Congress and helped include protections for domestic peanuts against rising Chinese imports in 1922.[^15] Peanuts were now associated with agricultural advancement and culinary innovation—and their star was still on the rise.

Today, the U. S. is the fourth-largest peanut producer, after China, India, and Nigeria. Yet Americans consume the greatest quantity of peanuts annually of any nation, a phenomenon due at least in part to the widespread popularity of peanut butter, which is a distinctly North American foodstuff—in 2020, 56% of U.S.-grown peanuts were processed into peanut butter.[^16] While George Washington Carver is sometimes credited with the invention of peanut butter, the first recipes actually began to appear around the the turn of the 20th century. These recipes call for roasting and shelling the penuts, and then grinding the nuts until they congeal into a paste, with salt and oil as optional additions. At first a tea-time delicacy, peanut butter was marketed as a protein-packed meat replacement during the rationing of World War 1, and its utility as a cheap energy source made it again ubiquitous during the Great Depression. A series of remarkable, relentless ad campaigns marketed peanut butter as suitable for all kinds of dishes, from peanut butter sandwiches and chocolate-peanut candies to savory roasts and soups. The American Empire shaped the peanut-related foodways of its colonies as well—peanut butter can be found in the Philippines, a former U.S. colony, and in Europe it is comparatively prevalent in Germany due to the historical and contemporary presence of American troops.

### Peanuts and Colonialism in East and West Africa
Peanuts are an integral commodity and actor in tracing colonial histories as demonstrated by its impact and influence in West Africa. A notable artifact representative of their intricate ties with colonialism is the 1953 <span eid="Q2046345">colonial Nigerian</span> stamp showing both the British Crown Queen Elizabeth II and the groundnut plants that were crucial to the Nigerian economy. Peanuts or *arachides* in French-speaking West Africa and *mancarra* in Portuguese Guinea crioulo were introduced to the Upper Guinea Coast in the sixteenth century by the Portuguese, however, it was not until the 1830s that peanut cultivation began to spread in the region.[^18] Peanuts are also the most important cash crop produced on the Upper Guinea Coast since the industrial revolution which created a growing demand for oils and fats. Historian George E. Brooks describes how the commercialisation of peanuts on the Upper Guinea Coast between 1830-70 helped French and Senegalese traders gain the dominant commercial position over British and Sierra Leonean rivals consequently leading to French political hegemony during the <span eid="Q179848">colonial partition</span>.[^19]

Great Britain's post-<span eid="Q362">World War II</span> <span eid="Q2392428">Tanganyika groundnut scheme</span> which took place between 1946-1951 is another landmark in the history of groundnuts. Vast areas of vegetation were cleared for the purpose of groundnut <span eid="Q220212">monoculture</span> with inadequate consideration to the conditions of climate and land. The crops did not yield as expected; and the scheme was untimately recorded as a large-scale agricultural failure. Ultimately the British Government abandoned the scheme. In the narrativising of this history, ["Martin Mahony"](http://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/enemy-nature-military-machines-and-technological-bricolage-britains-great-agricultural) notes a continued rhetoric of being in "war" with the land in Tanganyika and the actual *repurposing of war machines into agricultural equipment*: "At the sites chosen for the groundnut scheme, tractors and bulldozers from military surplus stores in Egypt proved unable to tackle the hard ground and tough vegetation, so the planners turned to a novel solution: repurposing surplus <span eid="Q191643">Sherman M4A2 tanks</span>".[^20] Today groundnuts are grown in present-day Tanzania by smallholder farmers and it ranks ["12th"](https://www.atlasbig.com/en-in/countries-by-peanut-production) in global peanut production.

### Peanuts: Politics and Public Space
A characteristic feature of peanuts is their presence in public spaces. Roasted or boiled, shelled or de-shelled, in street-carts or on the roadside, in cones of newspaper or paper bags, selling peanuts as street-food is a global practice. This public visibility has been documented in varied media representations of the peanut interacting with human and non-human actors. For example, the significance of the peanut vendor as the mediator in peanut consumption is brilliantly conveyed by the 1927 song <span eid="Q3050049">*El manisero* [*The Peanut Vendor*]</span> by the Cuban composer and song-writer <span eid="Q661928">Moisés Simons</span>.[^21] The composition is sung from the perspective of the seller, and was an example of the African and Afro-Cuban influenced <span eid="Q4428744">*son*</span> and <span eid="Q5681688">*pregón*</span> genres that went on to be recorded over 160 times. In 2005, *El manisero* was added to the [National Recording Registry](https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/registry-by-induction-years/2005/) in recognition of its influence in the history of Latin American music. The lyrics describe the vendor trying to tempt a housewife to buy a cone of peanuts, and include his repeated sales cry of "*maní*, *maní*, *maní*", a typical feature of *pregones*.

The political <span eid="Q89503149">chromolithograph</span> published in 1894 by <span eid="Q1584058">Puck magazine</span> titled *"Puck's presidential impossibility. The political peanut vender"*, uses the image of the peanut vendor in its satirical representation of the U.S politician and former governor of New York, <span eid="Q888410">David B. Hill</span>.[^22] The <span data-click-image-zoomto="255,522,315,291">peanut</span> in the image indicates a [“peanut politics”](https://politicaldictionary.com/words/peanut-politician/) or petty politics motivated by self-interest. Besides selling peanuts on streets and road-sides, vendors were often found at other public spaces like circuses, zoos, theatres, and fairs. The ubiquitous presence of peanuts as entertainment food in circus spaces led to spectators feeding peanuts to the animals, including elephants, as exemplified by this 1897 theatrical poster.[^23] Notably, feeding peanuts to elephants is not recommended as the animals require less protein and more fiber in their diet. Interestingly, the text *Marketing Peanuts* (1926) published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture notes the prohibition of the sale of shelled peanuts in public spaces in some cities in the U.S to curb the littering of peanut shells.[^24] The hull and broken peas left over after the industrial de-shelling process were also put to use in preparation of livestock feed especially during years of low quality crop or poor prices.

### Multispecies Consumption: Insects, Fungi, Bacteria
Humans, animals, and birds are not the only consumers of the peanut plant. In texts on peanut cultivation for human consumption like *The Peanut, the unpredictable legume; a symposium* (1951) published by the National Fertilizer Association in the U.S, we find the assertive presence of insects, fungi, and bacteria that feed on the peanut foliage, subterranean parts, and delicious pods.[^25] Insects like the Indian Meal Moth, <span eid="Q2893450">Almond Moth</span>, Saw-toothed Grain Beetle, and <span eid="Q102347715">Flour Beetles</span> are observed to consume peanuts after their harvest and when they are in storage. The consumption of the peanut plant by the insect is represented within the text as infestation by 'pests' which cause crop damage directly translating to economic ‘damage’. The insects in the network visualization are but a few of the many wondrous creatures that share humanity’s appetite for the peanut plant. While this network is by no means an exhaustive list of all the insects that feed on the peanut plant, it opens up thinking about the plant as providing nutrients to multiple life forms beyond the human.

       url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KatherineMEnright/Peanut/main/D3%20Ring%20Network%20Peanut.tsv"
       center="Arachis hypogaea">

The text also notes other life forms that consume the peanut which include bacterial and fungal entities which leave their unique markers of consumption: “<span eid="Q4840003">bacterial wilt</span> in the East Indies, <span eid="Q58935125">rosette</span> in Africa, and <span eid="Q6508875">leaf spot</span> in the southern United States”.[^26] The <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="195,105,766,725">roots</span> of the peanut plant are the center for multi-species reciprocity with <span eid="Q9164450">nitrogen-fixing bacteria</span> which take from and give back to the soil. Even after harvesting the plant, the peanut shells are sometimes returned to the soil to be used as fertilizer [^27]; to be 'consumed' by the soil.

Despite the use of the word ["peanut"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peanut) to denote a small or meagre amount in the English language, we have seen over the course of this essay that the peanut has a rich global history which is intricately tied to histories of colonialism and imperialism. Perceptions of the peanut are distinctive based on their cultural and temporal contexts: from refering to the cheapest seats in the theater as the ["peanut gallery"](https://theconversation.com/the-complicated-origin-of-the-expression-peanut-gallery-148897), a term which was also used as a racist and classist slur in early nineteenth century U.S, to the <span eid="Q17019494">groundnut pyramids</span> that were a status symbol and tourist attraction in Kano, Nigeria in the early twentieth century. From luxury food to livestock feed, the social, cultural, and political life of this legume is extensive. The peanut plant heals and replenishes  soils and has therefore been cultivated as a global environmental intervention method to maintain soil health. It is highly nutritious and protein-packed and hence beneficial to the many life-forms that consume it-- including to humans in many different culinary preparations-- and yet is also a food that causes fatal <span eid="Q7157933">allergic</span> reactions, a medical phenomenon that continues to puzzle peanut fans and detractors alike.
