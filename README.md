### Cultural History of Pesticide: "The Desolate Year", published by the Monsanto Company in 1962
"A brochure published by the agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto in 1962 in response to Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, which was a foundational work in early environmentalism criticizing the uncontrolled usage of pesticides and DDT in particular. The brochure tells the story of what they believe America would look like were the government to ban the usage of pesticides." (From The Internet Archive) Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" remains an influential work in the history of environmental literature and is often required reading for those interested in environmental science and conservation. It's a testament to the power of scientific literature to bring attention to critical environmental issues and drive change.
