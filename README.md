### Cultural History of Pesticide: "The Desolate Year", published by the Monsanto Company in 1962
"A brochure published by the agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto in 1962 in response to Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, which was a foundational work in early environmentalism criticizing the uncontrolled usage of pesticides and DDT in particular. The brochure tells the story of what they believe America would look like were the government to ban the usage of pesticides." (From The Internet Archive) Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" remains an influential work in the history of environmental literature and is often required reading for those interested in environmental science and conservation. It's a testament to the power of scientific literature to bring attention to critical environmental issues and drive change.

### Insect Repellent Ads, Mortein, 1949
How did 20th century advertisements for insect repellents consitute the pest? Mortein is a well-known brand of household insecticides and pest control products. The brand is owned by Reckitt Benckiser, a British multinational consumer goods company. Mortein products are designed to help people combat various pests, primarily insects, including mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches, ants, and other common household pests.
History: Mortein was originally an Australian brand, founded by J. Hagemann in 1878. The brand's name is derived from a combination of the French word "mort" (meaning "dead") and "Einstein," referencing the scientist Albert Einstein. In 1936, Mortein introduced its iconic slogan, "When you're dead, you're dead."

Environmental Concerns: Like many companies in the pest control industry, Mortein has faced scrutiny and challenges related to the environmental impact of its products. There have been concerns about the use of certain chemicals in insecticides and their effects on the environment. In response to these concerns, Mortein, like other companies, has been working on developing more environmentally friendly and sustainable pest control solutions.
Image: Mortein is known for its distinctive packaging and branding, often featuring the image of a dead insect, reinforcing its promise of effective pest control.

### Out of the Americas
Peanuts were first encountered by the Spanish on the Caribbean island of <span eid="Q25277">Hispaniola</span> in the late fifteenth century, where they were known by the name *maní* in the indigeous <span eid="Q5232952">Taíno</span> language. *Maní* is still the predominant name for peanuts in Latin America today, having been adopted into Spanish. Diverging from the appreciation of peanuts by many Pre-Columbian societies, Spanish chronicler <span eid="Q919967">Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo</span> linked their consumption on the island to people of low social standing who were not true Christians.[^8] The Spanish located them here as well as in the continental Americas, which led to confusion about the plant’s origins until peanut remains were located in a Pre-colombian tomb in Peru during the nineteenth century.[^9]

While the arrival of the peanut in Europe was relatively slow, <span eid="Q683846">Spanish Galleons</span> transported peanuts westward from the Americas to <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="15.20,131.31">China, the Philippines, and the Pacific Islands</span> throughout the sixteenth century. Simultaneously, peanuts were being transported across the world by the Portuguese, who had also encountered the legume in Brazil around 1500. The peanut was transported from Brazil to the <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="-16.13,-12.30">Portuguese enclaves on the West Coast of Africa</span>, where it spread across the continent. The peanut was often used as sustenance for enslaved peoples as it could be stored for long periods of time and its hard outer shell helped to protect it from spoilage. From Africa, it was  transported to <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="2.64,60.29">Portuguese India</span>, where it was initially termed the "Mozambique bean," and also to China.

The first mention of peanuts in a Chinese text dates to 1503, a mere decade after Columbus' "discovery" of the Americas. The manuscript describes boiled or cooked peanuts as "delicious" and gives the origin of its Chinese name 落花生 *luo hua sheng* (commonly now just 花生 *hua sheng*), literally "born from a fallen flower," which is how peanuts were thought to grow.[^10] Over the next centuries, peanuts rose in popularity across China as they gradually spread inland from the trading ports of southern coastal cities. Though now ubiquitous in Chinese cuisine, peanuts were a luxury food served at banquets and out of reach for many until the 19th century. The peanut came to be imbued with new cultural meanings as well, as shown in the <span eid="Q8733">Qing Dynasty</span> agate carving to the right depicting a pair of peanuts alongside red dates. The carving is a play on words: the characters for red date (枣, *zao*) and peanut (生, *sheng*), are homophones for the first two characters of the auspicious greeting 早生贵子 *zao sheng gui zi*, an encouragement for newly wed couples to soon have children.[^11]

### Mass Consumption: Peanuts as American Staple       
Although peanuts originated in South America, their journey north was circuitous—in fact, peanuts were introduced to the United States through Africa, crossing the Atlantic in the hulls of slave ships. This history is embedded in the language of peanuts—the common moniker “goober” entered American English from *nguba* in Kimbundu, a language spoken in Angola; “pinder,” another term for peanuts in the American South, derives from *mpinda* in the Kongo language.[^12] In contrast to the peanut's high status in the pre-Colombian Americas and Qing China, in early 19th-century America peanuts were often planted by slave communities and otherwise used as feed for livestock. It was around the <span eid="Q8676">Civil War</span> that peanuts became more widely popular among southern whites. Southerners turned to peanuts in the face of wartime food shortages, and the crop’s military utility was exploited as peanut oil replaced embargoed Northern whale oil as machinery lubricant.[^13] The popularity of peanuts at the time is commemorated in the southern folk song once sung by Confederate soldiers, “Goober Peas.” The lyrics and music are humorously attributed to "A. Pinder" and "P. Nut," both puns on the peanut's name. After the war, spurred on by advances in agricultural technology, the peanut spread throughout the country.

Instrumental to the rise of the peanut was <span eid="Q296898">George Washington Carver</span>, the pioneering Black agricultural scientist, who devoted much of his career to popularizing the crop. Carver, who was born into slavery in Missouri and taught at the Tuskegee Institute during his scientific career, sought to promote crops that could be planted as an alternative to cotton in the American South. Over a century of cotton monoculure had caused widespread nutrient depletion and erosion in the southern soils, and so Carver proposed peanuts as a solution: As nitrogen-fixing legumes, peanuts could return nutrients to the soil as part of a crop rotation that would boost the yield of future cotton plantings. A [1916 Tuskegee Institute report](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/209426#page/17/mode/1up) illustrates Carver’s incredible creativity in devising 105 recipes for peanut-based foods; he also invented a number of other uses for peanuts, including products made from peanut oil.[^14] An influential Black public figure during the age of segregation, Carver promoted peanut production on a local and a national scale—he even testified on behalf of peanut farmers before Congress and helped include protections for domestic peanuts against rising Chinese imports in 1922.[^15] Peanuts were now associated with agricultural advancement and culinary innovation—and their star was still on the rise.

Today, the U. S. is the fourth-largest peanut producer, after China, India, and Nigeria. Yet Americans consume the greatest quantity of peanuts annually of any nation, a phenomenon due at least in part to the widespread popularity of peanut butter, which is a distinctly North American foodstuff—in 2020, 56% of U.S.-grown peanuts were processed into peanut butter.[^16] While George Washington Carver is sometimes credited with the invention of peanut butter, the first recipes actually began to appear around the the turn of the 20th century. These recipes call for roasting and shelling the penuts, and then grinding the nuts until they congeal into a paste, with salt and oil as optional additions. At first a tea-time delicacy, peanut butter was marketed as a protein-packed meat replacement during the rationing of World War 1, and its utility as a cheap energy source made it again ubiquitous during the Great Depression. A series of remarkable, relentless ad campaigns marketed peanut butter as suitable for all kinds of dishes, from peanut butter sandwiches and chocolate-peanut candies to savory roasts and soups. The American Empire shaped the peanut-related foodways of its colonies as well—peanut butter can be found in the Philippines, a former U.S. colony, and in Europe it is comparatively prevalent in Germany due to the historical and contemporary presence of American troops.

### Peanuts and Colonialism in East and West Africa
Peanuts are an integral commodity and actor in tracing colonial histories as demonstrated by its impact and influence in West Africa. A notable artifact representative of their intricate ties with colonialism is the 1953 <span eid="Q2046345">colonial Nigerian</span> stamp showing both the British Crown Queen Elizabeth II and the groundnut plants that were crucial to the Nigerian economy. Peanuts or *arachides* in French-speaking West Africa and *mancarra* in Portuguese Guinea crioulo were introduced to the Upper Guinea Coast in the sixteenth century by the Portuguese, however, it was not until the 1830s that peanut cultivation began to spread in the region.[^18] Peanuts are also the most important cash crop produced on the Upper Guinea Coast since the industrial revolution which created a growing demand for oils and fats. Historian George E. Brooks describes how the commercialisation of peanuts on the Upper Guinea Coast between 1830-70 helped French and Senegalese traders gain the dominant commercial position over British and Sierra Leonean rivals consequently leading to French political hegemony during the <span eid="Q179848">colonial partition</span>.[^19]

Great Britain's post-<span eid="Q362">World War II</span> <span eid="Q2392428">Tanganyika groundnut scheme</span> which took place between 1946-1951 is another landmark in the history of groundnuts. Vast areas of vegetation were cleared for the purpose of groundnut <span eid="Q220212">monoculture</span> with inadequate consideration to the conditions of climate and land. The crops did not yield as expected; and the scheme was untimately recorded as a large-scale agricultural failure. Ultimately the British Government abandoned the scheme. In the narrativising of this history, ["Martin Mahony"](http://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/enemy-nature-military-machines-and-technological-bricolage-britains-great-agricultural) notes a continued rhetoric of being in "war" with the land in Tanganyika and the actual *repurposing of war machines into agricultural equipment*: "At the sites chosen for the groundnut scheme, tractors and bulldozers from military surplus stores in Egypt proved unable to tackle the hard ground and tough vegetation, so the planners turned to a novel solution: repurposing surplus <span eid="Q191643">Sherman M4A2 tanks</span>".[^20] Today groundnuts are grown in present-day Tanzania by smallholder farmers and it ranks ["12th"](https://www.atlasbig.com/en-in/countries-by-peanut-production) in global peanut production.

### Multispecies Consumption: Insects, Fungi, Bacteria
Humans, animals, and birds are not the only consumers of the peanut plant. In texts on peanut cultivation for human consumption like *The Peanut, the unpredictable legume; a symposium* (1951) published by the National Fertilizer Association in the U.S, we find the assertive presence of insects, fungi, and bacteria that feed on the peanut foliage, subterranean parts, and delicious pods.[^25] Insects like the Indian Meal Moth, <span eid="Q2893450">Almond Moth</span>, Saw-toothed Grain Beetle, and <span eid="Q102347715">Flour Beetles</span> are observed to consume peanuts after their harvest and when they are in storage. The consumption of the peanut plant by the insect is represented within the text as infestation by 'pests' which cause crop damage directly translating to economic ‘damage’. The insects in the network visualization are but a few of the many wondrous creatures that share humanity’s appetite for the peanut plant. While this network is by no means an exhaustive list of all the insects that feed on the peanut plant, it opens up thinking about the plant as providing nutrients to multiple life forms beyond the human.

       center="Arachis hypogaea">

The text also notes other life forms that consume the peanut which include bacterial and fungal entities which leave their unique markers of consumption: “<span eid="Q4840003">bacterial wilt</span> in the East Indies, <span eid="Q58935125">rosette</span> in Africa, and <span eid="Q6508875">leaf spot</span> in the southern United States”.[^26] The <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="195,105,766,725">roots</span> of the peanut plant are the center for multi-species reciprocity with <span eid="Q9164450">nitrogen-fixing bacteria</span> which take from and give back to the soil. Even after harvesting the plant, the peanut shells are sometimes returned to the soil to be used as fertilizer [^27]; to be 'consumed' by the soil.
